üß† Quantitative Finance Enhancements
1. Real-Time Market Data Integration
    - Integrate with APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or IEX Cloud to:
        - Pull current option chains and underlying prices
        - Auto-fill model inputs
    - Add a ticker input and populate the S, K, T, r, and œÉ dynamically.

2. IV Surface Visualization
    - Calculate and plot the Implied Volatility Surface from market prices across various strikes and expirations.
    - Use interpolation (e.g., cubic splines) to smooth the surface.

3. American Option Pricing
    - Implement pricing using binomial trees or finite difference methods for American options.
    - Compare it against European pricing from BSM.

4. Monte Carlo Simulation
    - Add a pricing module using Monte Carlo methods for path-dependent options (e.g., Asian, Barrier).
    - Show convergence visually and compare with analytical results (if available).

üìà Risk Management and Portfolio Applications
5. Portfolio of Options
    - Let users upload a CSV of positions and calculate:
        - Portfolio greeks
        - Total exposure to underlying, volatility, time, etc.

    - Allow visualizations like P&L heatmaps or sensitivity plots.

6. Scenario Analysis
    - Show how option value and greeks change under:
        - Shifts in volatility (volatility shock)
        - Changes in interest rates or time decay (calendar spread effects)

ü§ñ Machine Learning & Data Science
7. Volatility Forecasting
    - Implement GARCH or rolling standard deviation models to estimate forward volatility.
    - Show users predicted volatility and how that impacts option pricing.

8. Implied vs Realized Volatility Backtest
    - Compare historical implied vs realized vol for options to show mispricings.
    - Highlight strategies like straddles, strangles, or volatility arbitrage.

9. Option Price Prediction with ML
    - Train models (e.g., XGBoost or neural nets) to estimate option prices from input features and compare with BSM outputs.
    - Could be extended to exotic options or illiquid markets.

üìä UI / UX Enhancements (Streamlit-specific)
10. Interactive Volatility Smile
    - Plot the volatility smile from market options.
    - Let users select expiration dates and see how smile shifts with maturity.

11. Greeks Sensitivity Plots
    - Use sliders to vary inputs (S, T, œÉ, etc.) and dynamically show how each Greek changes.
    - Create 3D plots or heatmaps (Plotly integration is ideal).

12. Notebook Export / Report Generator
    - Add a "Download Report" button that generates a PDF with the user's inputs, pricing results, greeks, and visualizations.
    - Useful in professional or academic environments.

üèóÔ∏è Code Quality & Architecture
13. Modular Design
    - Refactor into modules: pricing.py, greeks.py, data.py, visuals.py, main.py.
    - Add unit tests using pytest or unittest.

14. API Back-End
    - Build a Flask or FastAPI backend that exposes option pricing via REST API.
    - Useful for integration into larger quant systems or trading dashboards.
